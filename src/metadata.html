  <meta name="description" content="We derive closed-form expressions for multifold sums of powers using Newton’s central differences formula, evaluated at an arbitrary integer point. Knuth’s formula for odd-power sums emerges naturally at zero, and Mathematica code is provided to verify the results." />
