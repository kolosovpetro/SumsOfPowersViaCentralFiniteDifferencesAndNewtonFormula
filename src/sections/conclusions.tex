In this manuscript, we derived formula for multifold sums of powers
using Newton's formula in central differences, combined with
hockey-stick identity for binomial coefficients.
Additionally, we shown that the famous Knuth's formula for multifold sums of
powers~\cite{knuth1993johann} originates from
Newton's formula in central differences.
