In this manuscript,
we derive formulas for multifold sums of powers
\eqref{theorem:multifold-centered-sums-of-powers},
\eqref{prop:binomial-form-of-multifold-centered-sums-of-powers},
\eqref{prop:negated-binomial-centered-sums-of-powers}, and others,
using Newton's formula in central differences,
evaluated at an arbitrary integer $t$.
We utilize hockey-stick identities for binomial coefficients,
namely \eqref{prop:generalized-hockey-stick-identity}
and \eqref{prop:centered-hockey-stick-identity},
to compute closed forms of column sums of binomial coefficients.
These closed forms are then used in the derivation of formulas
for multifold sums of powers.
Additionally, we show that Knuth's formula for multifold sums of
odd powers $n^{2m-1}$~\cite{knuth1993johann}
arises naturally from Newton's formula in central differences,
evaluated at $t=0$.
All main results of this manuscript are validated using programs
written in Wolfram Mathematica; see Section~\eqref{sec:mathematica}.
