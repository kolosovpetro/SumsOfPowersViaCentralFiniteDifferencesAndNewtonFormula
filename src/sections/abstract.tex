In this manuscript, we derive closed-form expressions for multifold sums
of powers using Newton's interpolation formula in central differences,
evaluated at an arbitrary integer point $t$. We further show that Knuth's
formula for multifold sums of odd powers arises naturally from Newton's
interpolation formula in central differences evaluated at zero.
Additionally, we provide Wolfram Mathematica programs
to validate the main results.
